## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm new to all of this. Studied music, but now I wonder if learning some It skills might be fruitfull.

As I don't have a clue of what I'm doing, I'll just focus on learning the fundamentals of GitHub and coding on Python.

I hope I'll be able to change this brief introduction in the short future, presenting some insteresting initial projects.
